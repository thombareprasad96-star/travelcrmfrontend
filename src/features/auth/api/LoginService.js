// src/features/auth/api/LoginService.js
//
// The tenant workspace login. ONE realm: tenant users.
//
// This form used to probe auth/superadmin/login first and fall back to the tenant endpoint, so a
// platform SuperAdmin could sign in here — and AdminLogin then persisted that platform JWT under
// localStorage["token"], the TENANT key. Nothing downstream re-checked the realm: router.jsx gates
// on a token merely existing, so the SuperAdmin got the whole tenant shell, and every tenant
// endpoint that casts the principal to `User` was handed a principal it cannot cast. The
// notification bell was just the first thing to call home on mount, once per page load.
//
// The platform realm has its own login at /superadmin/login, its own token ("sa_token"), and its
// own axios instance — ConsoleLogin's comment states the invariant this file used to break:
// "never `token` — a tenant session must survive alongside it". This form no longer knows the
// platform realm exists, which is the only durable way to keep that true.
